About the custom switch for the minishows app, you can subclass UIControl and create your switch from scratch (adding subviews to it, animations between different states, etc.) or you can use any of the available pods/projects on github. This is the best one I have found: https://github.com/bvogelzang/SevenSwitch

Small Tip: if you don't want to use SevenSwitch 2.0 for being Swift-Only get the 1.4 version (Obj-C) from the github repo

# Models

## Exercise 1

- Create an iPhone application using UITabBarController with two sections. Each section would be UITableViewControllers that would present TVShows and Movies. 

- Create two entity classes. A class for representing TVShows and another one for representing Movies

- Implement NSCopying on both classes

- Populate each table with TVShows and Movies generated randomly (content is irrelevant for this practice. It could be random strings)

- Implement some UI that allow the user to duplicate one of the previously created entities class. 

- Implement NSCoding on both classes

- Save all entities to disk using NSKeyedArchiver (suggestion: when switching sections)

- Recover all saved data using NSKeyedUnarchiver

- Try to do it using TDD

- Test at least your NSCopy and NSCoding implementations


## Exercise 2

- Use previous project to implement Equality on TVShows and Movies classes

- Implement hash on both classes

- Implement custom Equality methods

- Implement some UI that allow the user to compare between entities. (duplicated entities must match and others must mismatch)

- Implement some UI that allow the user to search into the datasource for it (containsObject:)

- Try to do it using TDD

- Test at least isEqual, isEqualTo_ClassName_  and hash methods


## Exercise 3

- Fork your previous project to redo everything using Mantle

- Add Mantle using CocoaPods

- Remove Equality, NSCoding & NSCopying implementation and make all entities extend MTLModel

- Check that your Tests still pass


## Exercise 4

- Implement MTLJSONSerializing protocol

- Try to do it using TDD

- Test at least that all your new concretion properties have the correct value

- Create a new class to read from JSON and return your entities populated with data

- Load an example JSON (provided by teacher) and obtain TVShows

Guys, a smal disclaimer about PDKTModelBuilder : It is a work in progress project and it's absolutely not recommended for using it in a production code. Feel free to take a look on it and give us feedback. Any contribution is welcome :wink: (It still don't implements NSCoding/NSCoping and stuff like that. It is focused on parsing data and creating entities objects. Specially CoreData objects)

A quick summary of  Norbert speech. Norbert Brunner is a development manager at BetVictor, a UK online gambling company with branchs in Gibraltar, Malaga, Hungary.. More than a typical speech was a Q&A type session on what it is like to be a mobile developer in an enterprise like BetVictor.
Just to say the presentation was really informative, they have open positions on the company all the time. He said that the company is quite transparent and affordable, don't hesitate to contact him directly for open iOS positions, His email is Norbert.Brunner@betvictor.com
